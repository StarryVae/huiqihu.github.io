Short bio: I got my bachelor's degree at Xidian University and I recieved my Phd's degree at Tsinghua University supervised by Prof. Guoliang Li (<http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ligl/>). Now I'm an assistant professor at School of Data Science and Engineering (**DASE**), East China Normal University (**ECNU**). My main research interests are database and distributed systems and algorithms.


#### Description of Lab Dase-314

I run a small lab studying database and distributed systems. Our research area includes: storage, in-memory and parallel computing,  query processing and optimization, transaction processing. In the lab, we prefer study open-sourced systems or open-sourced projects. 

Specifically, my recent interests include distributed storage system and indexes with new hardwares(RDMA and NVM), parallel logging with varients of Paxos/Raft protocols, indexing and increamental view maintenance for kv/database/streaming systems.
